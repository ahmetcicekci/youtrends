The [get_upload_audio.py](get_upload_audio.py) script uses [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), a powerful command-line tool for downloading videos and audio from YouTube and other platforms. Given a list of video IDs, the script downloads the corresponding audio streams in MP3 format and uploads them to Amazon S3 for storage.
